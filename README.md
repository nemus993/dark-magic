# Dark Magic

DarkMagic is a rich, comprehensive set of utility functions and modules for
Elixir that are useful for everyday programming.

The complete documentation is available [here](TODO).

## Installation

To use DarkMagic with your projects, edit your `mix.exs` file and add it as a
dependency:

``` elixir
def deps do
  [{:dark_magic, "~> 0.0.1"}]
end

def application do
  [applications: [:dark_magic]]
end
```

## Quick Introduction

The following line includes `DarkMagic` in your module and extends Elixir's core
modules.

``` elixir
use DarkMagic
```

Example:

``` elixir
defmodule Example do
  use DarkMagic

  def example_calculation do
    rangeA = 11..20
    rangeB = 15..25

    # dark magic's extensions for the core Elixir library
    Range.overlap?(range_a, range_b)
  end
end
```

## Development

### Roadmap

Before hitting `1.0` we want to implement all the features on the [TODO
list](TODO.md).

### Issues

Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests.

### Contributions

Please refer to each project's style guidelines and guidelines for submitting
patches and additions. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

### Design Principles

We care deeply about tests, clarity and performance. Please follow the following
rules when you make a contribution:

1. Write tests before code
2. Write documentation
3. Provide executable examples in your documentation a.k.a doctests
4. Keep doctests simple and cover only the most useful examples
5. Tests for edge-cases and complex examples should be placed in test files
